About channels
--------------

This is very important. Anyone can say whatever they want. They send the same old ZBLOCK. DATA is different of course.
To make it easy:
```
{
	"action": "channel/add",
	"data": {
		"channel":"<ipns-link>"
	}
}
```
... whatever, let's find out later




Create a structure
------------------

All basis is `akctl`

Components
----------
